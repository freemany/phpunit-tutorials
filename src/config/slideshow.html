<p>In this tutorial, we have a Building object which does not implement MotionInterface
 which means it cannot move. Right, a building erects but never move in the real world.</p>

<p>We don't need to test this Building class as it is empty, but we would like to test what happens if Person pushes a building.
    In the design of the push method, the Person should not move the building because the interface check as below.</p>
<pre><code class="php">
public function push(Thing $object): ?string
{
    <span class="bg-info">if ($object instanceof MotionInterface) {</span>

    <span class="bg-info">return $object->move();</span>
    <span class="bg-info">}</span>

    return null;

<p>Is it true, let the test speak.</p>
